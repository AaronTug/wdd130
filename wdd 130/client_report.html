    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>I decided the content to use on a whim, simply because I was running out of time
       and it was one i was interested in.<br>
       I mostly communicated Via email, but this did mean that both of us had long times
       when we didn't talk.<br>
       I did not give manny expectations, but was genuienly supprised at how well it 
       looked, Although the pictures in "weekly chalange" had trouble showing<br>
       Next time I would work more on the wireframe, and more details on what exactly
       I want, insted of giving them a bunch of things and say "figure it out"<br>

    <h2>Lead Dev Report</h2>
    <p> I mostly let my junior devs figure things out and report to me occasionally (might have
        forgoten to talk to them for a bit). I put their tasks on the readme file, and let
        them work. <br>
        I communicated with my client through email primarly, but they didn't check on me often,
        nor did I send reports often.<br>
        I simply published my site with the resources in github, and gave my client the link.
        My experiance with GitHub was about what you'd expect, I think my experianc was clean and simple<br>

    <h2>Junior dev Report</h2>
    <p>I mostly comunicated throgh email with one, and microsoft teams for another, but
       I dont go on teams often, which lead to lots of time before some things were seen.<br>
       For one site, I saw the wireframe, and the resources, and my lead came and sat down and
       talked to me, for another, I didn't get anything and didn't know what I needed to make.<br>
       I made some contributions, but I feel I could have done more if I had focused, and
       not procrastinated.<br>
       I did not run into issues with Github while working on the sites.<br>

    <h2>General Experiance</h2>
    <p>The most chalanging part, was staying focused, and working on it until the end,
        and I feel like I didn't overcome it.<br>
        I enjoyed making relitivly real sites, and having something, no matter how small to
        show for my work, and go from an idea to a thing.<br>
        If given another chance, I would have set aside time for longer to work on the sites, and
        followed a daily schedual to work on them, and keep improving them.<br>
        I do feel slightly more confident, in that I know I can do at least some of it
        since I've done it before, but I'm still nervous, and don't expect that nervousness to leave<br>
